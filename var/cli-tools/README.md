# CLI Tools

You need tools in these containers, put them here and we will expose them to the appropriate containers 
so you can excute them.

## Installing Tools

You can simply copy them to this directory, we also maintain a few big ones (n98-magerun, artisian, etc)
and can download them using the bin/cli-tools-download cmd or through the engine executable (eventually).
